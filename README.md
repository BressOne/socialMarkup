Here is my implementation of html+css task given due It-Shark  training in Brest in winter-spring 2018.
Link to training is [here](https://github.com/it-shark-pro "Сайт Google") for your any needs.

___
In this task we needed to show our skills or learn (as for me) html+css and [BEM](https://en.bem.info/methodology/key-concepts/ "BEM here") .
Due it was my first try in making html page and using BEM methodics in naming i think there are quite a lot of silly mistakes. So dont judje me. But I bet you do ):
___
While compleating thise task I was using sublimetext3 and [advocode trial](https://avocode.com/) (it is awsome, try it - it worth your time, i promise). And of course i used chrome as browser.

___
To run my projct simply fork it and run the main.html in html folder.

## All feedbacks are welcome and apriciated!
